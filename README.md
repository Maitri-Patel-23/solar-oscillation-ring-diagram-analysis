# Solar Oscillation Analysis Using FFT

This notebook performs:

- Reading of Doppler velocity FITS data from HMI
- Running difference analysis to enhance oscillations
- Time series and power spectrum analysis of single pixels
- 3D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and ring-diagram visualization
- Identification of p-modes and f-modes

## Requirements

- astropy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy

## How to Run

```bash
pip install astropy numpy matplotlib scipy
